## Development

You need to have python installed or just use GitPod
```bash
# 1. Install Dependencies 
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 2. Run the preview locally
mkdocs serve
# 3. Make your changes and see them update live
# 4. Commit and the CI Pipeline will deploy your changes.
``` 

To get to know what is possible with MkDocs have a look at the [Documentation](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/reference/abbreviations/).
